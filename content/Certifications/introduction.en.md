## Kubernetes Certifications

The `Cloud Native Computing Foundation` offers three major certifications to validate your skills and expertise in managing Kubernetes clusters. These certifications are recognized worldwide and help validate your knowledge with recruiters and companies.

### **CKA (Certified Kubernetes Administrator)**

The **CKA** is intended for system administrators who want to demonstrate their mastery of Kubernetes cluster administration. It covers essential aspects of managing and operating a Kubernetes cluster.

### **CKAD (Certified Kubernetes Application Developer)**

The **CKAD** is suited for developers who want to prove their ability to design, build, and deploy cloud-native applications on Kubernetes. This certification focuses on development skills and using Kubernetes to run applications.

### **CKS (Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist)**

The **CKS** is an advanced security-oriented certification. It is ideal for Kubernetes professionals who want to deepen their expertise in securing Kubernetes clusters and applications, including network configuration, security policies, and vulnerability management.

## Certification Process

Kubernetes certifications are practical online exams that require using a terminal to solve real-world scenarios. You will have access to a Kubernetes cluster and must complete several tasks within a limited time.

### **Exam Structure**

- **Duration:** Approximately 2 hours.
- **Mode:** 100% online.
- **Questions:** 15 to 20 scenarios to solve on a real Kubernetes cluster.
- **Format:** Exam in a terminal embedded in a browser, with access to official Kubernetes documentation (https://kubernetes.io/).

### **Preparation**

It is recommended to have good knowledge of command-line tools (CLI) and Kubernetes before attempting the certifications. The exam is very practice-oriented, so it is essential to practice with Kubernetes clusters.

## The Environment

The exam environment is a secure space where you will have access to a terminal to interact with a Kubernetes cluster. Here are some elements to know before taking the exam:

- **Access to official documentation:** You have the right to consult official Kubernetes documentation during the exam. It is crucial to know how to quickly navigate the documentation.
- **Restrictions:** You cannot use local tools on your machine, nor copy/paste external scripts. Everything must be done in the provided environment.
- **Real-time supervision:** A person will monitor you via webcam throughout the exam to ensure its integrity.
